# Chocobo

Backbon-ify your iOS models and make it extremely easy to communicate with a RESTful API. Provides an easy API to connect, communicate and return success/failure events.

## Installation

Chocobo is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "Chocobo"

There's one other step that you will need to do in order to get it working. Add a file to your project and call it 'Environments.plist'. Inside of there you will need to specify your different API environments you want to use.

Now finally add a 'Configuration' parameter to your app's plist.

```c
# support/appName.plist

Configuration (String) 'dev(or whatever you named your environment you want to use)'

```

## Usage

Chocobo allows you to easily create async models/collections in your iOS app to communicate easily with a RESTful API.

### Models

Extend your model from the Model object and specify all the attributes using properties.

```c
@interface User : Model

@property (nonatomic, copy) NSNumber *userId;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *firstName;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *lastName;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *email;

@end
```

Next you will need to override the models method 'updateModelWithJson:'

```c
-(void) updateModelWithJson:(NSDictionary *)json
{
    NSDictionary *attributes = [json valueForKey:@"user"];
    self.userId = [attributes valueForKey:@"id"];
    self.firstName = [attributes valueForKey:@"first_name"];
    self.lastName = [attributes valueForKey:@"last_name"];
    self.email = [attributes valueForKey:@"email"];
}
```

Now you can call:

```
[self fetchFromEndpoint:@"login.json" withParams:parameters onSuccess:^(id responseObject) {

        NSLog(@"Do Something with your response object here");

    } onFailure:^(NSError *error)  {

        NSLog(@"Do something with the error");

    }];
```

### Collections

Collections will extend off the Collection object.

```c
#import "Collection.h"

@interface Users : Collection

@end
```

Your collection will then need to overide 2 functions

```c
-(id)model
{
    return @"User";
}

-(NSString *)collectionEndpoint
{
    return @"users.json";
}
```

This will allow the collection to automatically grab all the models from the collection
endpoint and set them in the models array.

Accessing the models in a collection are easy. Just use the models accessor.

```c
[[collection models] objectAtIndex: 0];
```

### Has Many Relationships

Setting up a has many relationship in your model is easy. Set up an NSMutableArray as a property on the
model of the model type that the relationship is set.

```c
# models/user.h

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableArray *accounts;
```

Synthesize and set up the relationship in a loop inside your updateModelWithJson: function

```c
# models/user.m

@synthesize wells = _wells;

-(void) updateModelWithJson:(NSDictionary *)json
{
    for (NSDictionary* key in [json valueForKey:@"accounts"]) {
        Account *accountModel = [[Account alloc] init];
        [accountModel updateModelWithJson:key];

        [self.accounts addObject:account];
    }
}
```

### Has One Relationships

To setup a has one relationship on your models, set up a property on your model of the type you would like to set it up with.

```c
# models/user.h

#import 'Account.h'

@property (nonatomic, retain) Account *account;
```

And then in updateModelWithJson:

```c
# models/user.m

-(void) updateModelWithJson:(NSDictionary *)json
{
    Account *account = [[Account alloc] init];
    [account updateModelWithJson: [json valueForKey:@"account"]];
    self.account = account;
}
```

## Development

To run tests cd into the `Tests` directory and run `pod install`. Then open the Chocobo.xcworkspace and run `command + u`. The Scheme must be set to `TestsTests`:
